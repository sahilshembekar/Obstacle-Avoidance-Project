## Implementation for obstacle avoidance robot project

- First folder contains a catkin workspace for the implemetation of object detection and avoidance using AMCL(Adapive Monte Carlo localization) algorithm. The system dependencies and results are described inside the folder's README file.
- Second folder contains code in C++ which will when implemented in ROS and simulated on Gazebo and Rviz will show obstacle avoidance. This code can be used standalone and does need any other packages of ROS.
